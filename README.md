# SQL_InsuranceSystemDatabase

This project delves into a hypothetical scenario wherein we are employed by General Insurance, an esteemed insurance company. Our mission, as entrusted by the company, is to undertake a pivotal project—the design and implementation of a comprehensive Database for the management of insurance products and packages, alongside the creation of a user-friendly online portal for their efficient administration.

# Database Management System Project

This project is a database management system that involves the creation of a database, setting up tables, constraints, views, SQL queries, triggers, functions, and procedures. The goal of the project is to manage insurance-related data efficiently.

## 1. Tables and Constraints

### Step 1: Database Creation
Create a database and define the necessary tables according to the specified requirements.

### Step 2: Adding Constraints
Implement relevant constraints within the database to enforce data integrity and structure.

## 2. Entity-Relationship Diagram

### Step 3: Creating ER Diagram
Use MySQL Workbench to generate the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ER Diagram) representing the database structure.

## 3. Views

### Step 4: Create Views
Develop both updatable and non-updatable views according to the project's requirements.

## 4. SQL Queries

### Step 5: Execute Queries
Create and execute the following SQL queries in the database:
- Present the number of contracts per insurance product.
- Present customers sorted by the total cost of their contracts (from highest to lowest).


<div align="center">
  <h1>Folder - Step02</h1>
</div>

## 5. Triggers
### Step 6: Implement Triggers
Create triggers to automatically update the total cost of contracts for each customer.

## 6. Functions

### Step 7: Define a Function
Create a function that calculates the duration of contracts, considering contract start and end dates (e.g., 6 months).

## 7. Procedures

### Step 8: Develop a Procedure
Build a procedure that accepts a customer's VAT number (ΑΦΜ) and a date as input, and returns the number of contracts the customer holds for that specific month, along with the total payment for that month.

<div align="center">
  <h1>Folder - Step03</h1>
</div>

## 8. Display All Insurance Products
### Step 9: Web Page
Create a web page that displays all available insurance products.

## 9. Display Customers for Selected Insurance Product

### Step 10: Web Page with Dropdown
Design a web page where users can select an insurance product from a dropdown list. After selecting a product, display the customers who have at least one contract for the chosen insurance product.

## 10. Calculate Contracts for a Specific Customer

### Step 11: Web Page with Input
Develop a web page where users can input a customer's VAT number (ΑΦΜ) and a date. The page should return the number of contracts the customer holds for that month and the total amount they need to pay for that specific month.
